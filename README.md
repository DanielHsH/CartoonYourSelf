# CartoonYourself

This is an openCV based program which cartoonizes images and videos. Give it as input any image, a video file or connect it to the live camera, and instantly received a cartoon of the input media

The source files are somewhat large, since they include a generic media reader and writer. The algorithm of image-to-cartoon can be found in the method named cvExtPhoto2Pencil() in the file cv_extension.cpp
